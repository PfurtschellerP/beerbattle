# BeerBattle

This application was built in just one day. It is a simple game where you can choose a beer and fight against other beers. The winner is the beer with the best rating. The actual rating is calculated directly in the frontend (keep in mind: only a protoype) and uses a simple formula (elo-rating) to calculate the score.

## Why

The project was built for the Almer√≠a SummerSchool in 2022. It was used for a workshop game to market an idea using the Business Model Canvas. The prototype of this application was used to show the idea of the application. The audience could directly try out the idea and give feedback.
